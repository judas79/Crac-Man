https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTvVJDo6jvM&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=23

In this video we finish Ms. Pac-Man and learn how to do even more! 
We’ll create and set up all 4 Ghosts, position Ghosts in the center cell, 
return Ghosts after eaten, move Ghosts randomly, chase Ms. Pac-Man, 
have Ghosts eat Ms. Pac-Man, update scores and a whole lot more.

**************************** setup other ghosts ***************************


First, we will create prefabs, for our remaining three ghosts.
We will go into our sprites, and drag the first ghost, of each color, one at a time,
into our hierarchy, Ghosts empty.
Then rename our ghost, to its colors name + Ghost.  'PinkGhost' is the first ones name.
Then drag the ghost into our prefabs folder, and delete the ghost sprite, from hierarchy.
Do that, for all three.

Then drag the three ghost, into the hierarchy Ghosts empty, one at a time, from the prefab folder.

Next, select those same thre ghosts, in hierarchy, and ad a RigidBody 2d, to them.
settings for all three ghosts:
Mass = .0001
Gravity Scale = 0
Collision detectionv = continous
Constraints Freeze Rotation Z = checked

Next, add a BoxCollider 2D to thos same three Ghosts.
Settings for all three:
is Trigger = checked
Size X and Z bothe = .88

Next, while those t=same three ghosts are selected, drag your Ghost.cs script into the components area.
In the Ghost script area, settings:
speed = 3

Also, change the speed for the RedGhost, to 3, as well.

Next, we will select each of the PinkGhost, BlueGhost and Orange Ghost, one at a time,
then drag the corresponding Sprite, as far as color and the direction it is looking in,
into our Ghosts.cs, settings area.
For the OrangeGhost, the went in this order:
Look left = spriteSheet_4
Look right = spriteSheet_5
Look down = spriteSheet_7
Look up = spriteSheet_6

Do the same for the other two, using thier ghost color and eyes direction of view.

Then also drag in the Dark Blue ghost, into it Blue Ghost field, for all three.

Next, tag all three ghost, with the Ghost tag, in the dropdown, in settings.
Verify that the RedGhost is also tagged with the Ghost tag.

Next, double click the Ghost.cs script, and we will continue in VS...

After saving, and returning to Unity, aft creating wait times for the ghost to start,
and also then restart after being eaten, we will first select the RedGhost.


********************************* setup Ghost properties *********************************


In its, new properties, within the Ghost script in settings:
Start Wait Time = 2

PinkGhost:
Start Wait Time = 5

BlueGhost:
Start Wait Time = 10

OrangeGhost:
Start Wait Time = 15

Next, we will continue setting up for the Ghost, by cutting everingthing in our Start() function,
and move it into its own function, named 'StartMoving' which we will invoke, with Start().
We will also setup the starting position properties, for our Ghost, within the cell, in the middle of the game.
So continue in Ghost.cs within VS....

After saving, and returning from VS, we will change the starting positions, for all of our ghost.
We will also set all our cell positions, so that the ghosts are not siting on a Point
RedGhost Settings:
Position x = 12
Position y = 16
Cell X Pos = 11.5
Cell Y Pos = 15.5

PinkGhost Settings:
Position x = 13
Position y = 16
Cell X Pos = 12.5
Cell Y Pos = 15.5

BlueGhost Settings:
Position x = 14
Position y = 16
Cell X Pos = 13.5
Cell Y Pos = 15.5

OrangeGhost Settings:
Position x = 15
Position y = 16
Cell X Pos = 14.5
Cell Y Pos = 15.5

Next, run the game to verify the ghosts work as expected.

Next, in Unity we will set the Destination Indexes, for the 4 Ghosts.
0 is the Top Left,    'new Vector2( 1, 29)'
2 is the bottom left,  'new Vector2( 26, 1 ),

ReGhost:
Destination = 0
PinkGhost
Destination = 2
BlueGhost
Destination = 0
OrangeGhost
Destination = 2

Run the game to see if the ghosts go in different directions, when they start.

Next, in Ghost.cs, we will make, 'bool isGhostBlue = false;' public, so we can have access to the change of color,
and, that it can be eaten, when blue.  Then reset and get moving again, but now chase down pacman,
instead of randomly roaming the screen.

After saving and returning from setting up our ghost to do, after being killed,
we will set up how the ghost will go after pacman.


*********************************** Scoring, and ghosts chase pacman *********************************


First, we will assign an int, to pass in the score values, dependant on if its dots, Pills or ghosts,
into the IncreaseTextUIScore() function.
Next, we will set it up, how the ghosts will track and hunt down pacman.
Continue in the MsPacman.cs, in VS.....

After saving and returning to Unity, run to verify it all works.

SUCCESS!
