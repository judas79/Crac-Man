https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbjaQihr5RM&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=19

In this video I finish setting up the system that will allow Ms. Pac-Man to perfectly travel through the maze. 
We’ll cover how to calculate if Ms. Pac-Man can Move in Certain Dirctions, Working with GameObjects in an Array, 
Keeping Ms. Pac-Man from Getting Stuck, Simulating Hitting Walls, Animating, Changing Ms. 
Pac-Man’s Direction without Pivot Points and more.

All of the images are here and the code follows the video below.

First, we will launch our MsPacman Script, by double clicking it in Unity, to open in VS,
and continue writing code, to move MsPacman, only within the bounderies of the pacman maze.
So continue notes there, starting in the fixed update function...

After returning from tryin the code out, we will next work on, keeping MsPacman centered within the maze bounderies.
We will do this by setting the position of mspacman, every time it moves.
Being center, also ensures that MsPacman always starts on a 'snaps to pivot point' Turning point,
or she could get locked in a bad position, inside the game.
We will do this before we change the velocity, in the code area.
Resume in VS, with code an notes within MsPacman script...

after returning, verify it works.

Next, we will have Mspacman stop when she hits a wall.
Verify MsPacman has a circleCollider 2d on her.
Trigger is checked; 'set'
Tagged as MsPacman
And also verify that all the Points have a circleCollider 2d,
Trigger is set
Radius = .1

We will use the triggers when MsPacman hits a Point, to stop her, using OnTriggerEnter2d.
So, lets resume inside of VS, at the bottom of the MsPacman, creating the function; OnTriggerEnter2d.

After returning verify that mspacman stops when she hits a turningPoint Point.
If you hit the key she will continue through the wall.

We will continue by freezing mspacmans mouth or nose from movinge, when she stops.
Continue in VS MsPacman.cs, with notes...

after returning from creating our property 'public Sprite pausedSprite;' in MsPacman.cs,
we will drag our MsPacman sprite into the new public 'pausedSprite' field.
'SpriteSheet_18 in the tutorial.
Then return to the MsPacman.cs code, to the bottom of our script in, to create the function in vs...

After returning, verify it works in Unity.

Next, we will make it, so that the MsPacman can switch to the opposite direction, 
even if she is not on a turning point.
Continue in fixeUpdate, in the MsPacman.cs in VS....
