In this tutorial we continue making Ms. Pac-Man. This time we will Find out How to use Multiple Audio Sources, 
Set up Sound Effects, Allow Ms. Pac-Man to Eat Dots, Set up the Interface, Update Scores when She Eats Dot and a whole lot more.

All of the images used are here. The code follows the video below. You can also Download all of my Unity game files so far for Pong, 
Space Invaders, Tetris and Mario.

******************************** SoundManager ***********************************


First, we will create our SoundManager.
In hierarchy, create Empty, rename to SoundManager.
Withh SoundManager selected, go into settings area, in Add Component, choose, audio, then Audio source.
Do this two more times, to have a total of 3 audio sources. 
One will be pacman eating the second ghosts moving, and the third, oneShotSoundClip.

Drag the sound file from folder, into the Asset/Sounds folder in Unity.
EatingDots or, I used SniffingDots, for my version.
EatingGhosts
GhostMove
PacmanDies
PowerUpEating

We will drag, EatingDots or, SniffingDots, into the first Audio Source, that we just created,
into the AudioClip field, from our Sound folder.
Then GhostMove into the second one, in the AudioClip field.
Leave the third ones AudioClip field empty.  This will be used to oneShotSoundClip, which we will setup later.
In the 2nd and 3rd ones settings:
Play on Awake = unchecked

Next, create a script, and name it SoundManager.
Double click SoundManager to resume code and notes within VS...

After saving, and returning from setting up our Audio players for ghost, pacman and other sounds,
we will revisit the MsPacman script.
We will verify the sounds in Unitiy, to test if it works, later on.


******************************* Sounds in MsPacman script and Unity ***************************


Next, we will continue, in VS, by first adding a library to our MsPacman.cs.
Continue with notes in VS, MsPacman.cs....
Library to use the scoring UI
using UnityEngine.UI;

After setting up the ghost and pacman eating (sniffing) dots sound, we will now try it out,
in Unity.

It didn't work because we didn't finish setting up the sounds, in Unity.

First, select MsPacman and in settings/ MsPacman script, drag the corresponding sounds,
into thier fields, from the Sounds folder:
EatingGhost
PacmanDies
Powerup Eating

Also, select your SoundManager, then drag your SoundManager script into its settings.

Then Drag all the cooresponding sounds into thier fields, in the SoundManager Script.
Eating, or Sniffing dots
Eating Ghosts
Ghost Move
Pacman Dies
Powerup Eating

Now run your game in Unity to verify that it is working and sounding, properly.
MsPacman should make sounds when it moves, and stop making them when she stops.



******************************* setup score UI **********************************


Next, in the Unity hierarchy, Create a UI text, and rename it to Score.
Next, setup the canvas that was created, when we created the UI text, to the same position x / y,
as our camera:
Canvas settings:
Render Mode = WorldSpace
Position x = 13.
position y = 14.5
width = 40
height = 36

Next, select the MainCamera and in Settings:
Size = 18
This will put some more space up at the top of the scene area, for us to put the,
Score on.

Next, in hierarchy, select Score, and change settings to:
Position x = 1.
position y = 16
width = 40
heigth = 36
Text = 0
Font style = bold
color = 'white'
Scale x/y  = .07
Font Size = 22
Alignment : 'Centered'

Run it to verify the Score text looks good and clear.


******************************** setup Pills *********************************

I reversed the naming for the dots and the pills, accidently, so the so called Dots are named Pills,
and the Pills are named Dots. Woops!

In Unity, select all the Pills object folders and put a check by Pills in the inspector, so they show up,
in the scene screen.
Next, Select all the individual pills, in both the PillsHorz and PillsVert folders.
If the folders themselves are selected, unselect them by using ctrl and click, then
and add a boxcollider 2d to them.
Zoom in on them and shrink down the Size of the boxcollider 2ds, so they just cover the outside of the pills.
I will leave the Edge radius the same, for now, because the vertical pill are long and the horrizontal ones are wide.
Check : is Trigger

If you are doing my version of MsPacman (mine is Crac-Man)
Select all  the VertPill(s), and in thier BoxCollider setting set:
Size x = .6
Size y = .4

Select all  the HorizPill(s), and in thier BoxCollider setting set:
Size x = .4
Size y = .6

The MsPacman version uses a circleCollider 2d, and sets the radius to .7 for all.

So we can get points, when trigger calls it, as they are eaten, and the game will work as intended.

Next, Open the MsPacman script in VS and we will continue with out notes there...

Changes made because Dots and Pills names where reversly named.

// within the OnTriggerEnter2D(Collider2D col) function
// T20 If Pac-Man hit a Pill
        if (col.gameObject.tag == "Pill")
        {
            // call function and pass in the pill MsPacman collided with
            APillWasEaten(col);
        }


//function
// T20 When a Pill object was collided with
    void APillWasEaten(Collider2D col)
    {
        // call another function to increase the score
        IncreaseTextUIScore();

        // destroy the game object pill MsPacman collided with
        Destroy(col.gameObject);
    }


// function
// T20 increase the score when a pill is collided with 'eaten'  'sniffed up'
    void IncreaseTextUIScore()
    {
        // find the score UI component
        Text textUIComp = GameObject.Find("Score").GetComponent<Text>();

        // get the string stored inside of the Score and convert it to int
        int score = int.Parse(textUIComp.text);

        // increment the score
        score += 10;

        // resave the updated score in the textUIComp score string
        textUIComp.text = score.ToString();
    }
