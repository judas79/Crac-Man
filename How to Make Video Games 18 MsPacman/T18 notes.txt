How to Make a Video Game 18
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtVaV2Y7Mlg&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=19

In the next 2 videos I’ll cover how to lock Ms. Pac-Man perfectly inside of the maze as she moves around. 
We will do this not through colliders, but instead by using pivot points, which will make the movement very
clean and also resource light. We’ll cover how to Setup Pivot Points, Putting GameObjects in an Array, 
Selecting GameObjects in Code, Cycling through GameObjects in Empties, Moving Ms. Pac-Man, Animating Ms. 
Pac-Man and much more.

******************************************* folders tags, Point, misc.*******************************************

First we will create empty in hierarchy and name it, Turningpoints.
The reason we use Points instead of colliders, is that colliders would not be smooth, as turning points are.
Within Turningpoints we will create another create empty and name it Point.
In the Point settings, pick a color from the top, cube picture with dropdown,so yu can see the circle around the empty Points,
you are about to duplicate.
But first add a circle collider 2d to your Point, as to see the circle, also you can highten the radius, then return it to ,1 when finished,
if you don't see your Point.
Start your first point at:
position x = 1
position y = 1
Work your way to the top by duplicating your point, for each place the pacman character can turn at (66 places);  see image included.

Next, one set at a time, create a tag for:
Point for all your Point (s)
Dot   "        "
Pill both PillVert (s) and PillHorz (s)
MsPacman


************************************ TurningPoint ***************************************


Next we will create a TurningPoint script and continue our notes in VS....

After returning from VS, we will select all of our Point(s) in TruningPoints, then drag our TurningPoint script into the settings,
so all the Points have the script within them.
Within the setting of the script, notic is has a field named size.  This size will contain the nearest turningpoints, to the turning point your are currently at.
We will now select the first turningpoint at 
position x = 1,
position y = 1,
There are only two interse@cting turning points in this ones vicinity, in a linear pathway, one above it and one to the right.

   @ <- Point 1
||    |										|
||	  |_____________________________________|
|| @ <-current possition                  @<- Point 2
||==========================================


You have two points that have the potential of being the next point, dependant on weather the user goes up or right.
So, in size, enter 2, then click enter, and two fields will open up under the size field.
While the current position is selected, drag the Point 2, from hierarchy, into one of the fields, created by the size.
Next, hilight point 2 and add the former(current position), the Point that is above it, and the next Point, that is encoutered, to its right.
Do that for them all (66 Point total).

Add a circle collider 2d, and setting:
is Triggered : checked


***************************************** MsPacman ************************************

create a script named MsPacman, and attach it to the MsPacman object.
Add a Rigidbody 2d, settings:
collision detection = continuous
Constaints freeze z checked

create cirlcle collider 2d, settings
Radius .46
is Triggered : checked   (so when it hits a turning Point it reacts to it)


************************************** Gameboard **********************************************

Create script named, Gameboard, and attach it to the GridGB object.
This handle the array setup, to hold  all the turning points in the game, double click and continue notes in VS...

After returning from VS, where we created the code to put all ourpoints, and their positions, into the array,
we will continue by setting up our TurningPoint script.


********************************** TurningPoint Script *************************************

After finishing the Gameboard script, we will continue in our Turningpoint script,
so continue notes in VS...

Returned.... then MsPacman script

***************************************MsPacman script **************************************

After returning from TurningPoint script, we will resume in the MsPacman script,
with notes and code in VS....

After returning, your MsPacman should be able to go in all four directions,
but not respect bounderies, or stop at the boundery borders.
Run it in Unity and confirm that its working.
