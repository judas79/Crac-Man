How to Make a Video Game 21
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIrTVkDajH8&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=21

In this part of my Video Games Tutorial I show how to make the hardest part in Pac-Man, which is the Ghost AI Algorithm. 
We値l Create the Ghost AI so Ghosts Circle Around the Maze on their own, They値l React to Collisions with Pivot Points and 
They値l Always Remain Perfectly Centered. We値l also have the Ghosts Move Erratically, Use an Array to Store Game Objects, Make Ms. 
Pac-Man use Portals and a whole bunch more.

*************************** setup going through the portal **************************


We will first setup the ghost portal, in VS, within the OnTriggerEnter2D statement,
in the MsPacman.cs script.  
First, we will get the, two positions, for each turning point, at the far side ends, of the portal ends.
turning point on left side, point(60):
position x = 1
position y = 16
turning point on right side, point (63)
position x = 26
position y = 16
We will continue our notes and code, in VS...

After returning from setting out portals, run it in VS, to verify, the portals work correctly.


*********************************** Ghosts ****************************************


First, in the Unity hierarchy create empty and rename it to Ghosts.
Setting for the Ghosts empty, are the same as your positions x y, for turning points.
position x = -0.5
position y = -0.5

Everything for ghosts will depend on turning points, so the Ghost empty must be the same.

Next drag the sprite, spriteSheet(0), the red ghost, into the Ghosts empty.
Rename it to RedGhost.
Drag it into prefab, then delete RedGhost from hierarchy, and then drag the RedGhost, from prefab,
into the Ghosts empty.
Change the RedGhost position, in settings to:
position x = 14
position y = 19

Next, add a rigidbody 2D to the redGhost, and settings:
Mass = .0001
Gravity Scale = 0
collision detection = continous
Constraints/ freeze rotation = z is checked

Next, add a box collider 2d to the RedGhost, settings:
is Trigger = checked
Size: x = .88,   y =.88

Next, create a script, and name it Ghost.
Then drag the Ghost script into the botttom of the RedGhost settings.
Then, double click our Ghost script, and we will continue in VS....
Add 
using.System;
To our libraries, inside of Ghost.cs, this will handle detection, if the ghost hits the wall.

After saving, then returning to Unity, and verify that the RedGhost goes left,
across the screen, when you first run the game.

Next we will go copy a function named 'CanIMoveInDirection' from our MsPacman script, 
and paste it in our Ghost.cs script, at the bottom, below our OnTriggerEnter2D function.
The code will be altered to suit the needs to be sent a chosen direction and search for that direction,
in the array, that is going to hold refrences, called pivot points. 

Continue, in the 'CanIMoveInDirection' function, where you pasted it in the Ghosts script,
in VS...

After, saving, and returning here, after coding the solutions for the ghost to get to its destination point,
in the top left area of our maze,

We will go back into our ghost.cs in VS and write the code, for the other three, of the four quadrants,
the ghost cang go, looking to eat MsPacman, so continue there...

MY script would not work, so I copied the teachers, from the lesson!

After returning to Unity, we will first create a tag fo our ghost(s).
First, select our RedGhost, and create a tag named Ghost for it.
Then select RedGhost and choose Ghost from the dropdown, for tag.
Also, while creating your tag, create a new sorting layer and name Ghost.
Flip it to be higher than MsPacman, but lower than the default, by dragging it,
in the field of sorting layer, members.
Then select Ghost from the sorting layer dropdown for you redGhost.

Now, test that it runs correctly, with the ghost above the dots, and manuevers through the maze corectly.
