https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tvdbE1AbWA&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=22

In this part of my tutorial on making Ms. Pac-Man we learn all sorts of useful techniques. 
We’ll learn how to use arrays to keep Ms. Pac-Man in the maze, modeling a game board in an array, 
turning ghosts blue, animating ghosts, accessing game object scripts in code, going through portals, 
more about StartCoroutine, sound effects and much more.

All the Images are Here. The code follows the video below. You can also Download all of my Unity game files so far for Pong, 
Space Invaders, Tetris and Mario.

The first thing we will do, is fix the unwanted ability, of our pacman, to go through,
the blocks, that separate our maze.  Double click our Gameboard script in Unity,
and we will continue there, in VS, with our code and notes...

After saving our changes for Gameboard.cs, to keep MsPacman inside the borders of our maze,
we will now continue in MsPacman.cs.  We will implement the changes there, that we made in Gameboard.cs...

After saving, and returning from MsPacman.cs, we have returned to verify that our MsPacman, can no longer,
cut through the inner and outer walls, of our maze.  run game to verify.


******************************* animate ghost eyes ***************************

Next, we will animate our ghost, so that his eyes face in the direction that he is moving in.
First click your RedGhost, in hierarchy, and verify that you already created, the properties area, in the Ghost script,
for your variations of the red ghost sprites, to be dragged into.

Next, we will open up our Ghost script, and continue there...

After saving, and returning from setting up our Redghost to look in the direction,
he is moving in, run the game to verify.


******************************** Ghost goes through portals *******************************


Next, we will enable our ghost, to go through the portals.
Continue in Ghost.cs in the OnTriggerEnter2D function, withing VS...

********************************* Ghost turns Blue **********************************

Continue in Ghost.cs to turn our Ghost blue...
After saving, from making a place to store our blue ghost, select our RedGhost, in hierarchy,
and drag our blueGhost Sprite into the Blue Ghost field, in the Ghost scripts settings.
Now we can turn the RedGhost blue.

Next, we will return to our Ghost script, and make sure the BlueGhost is not animated, 
in our OnTriggerEnter2D function, within VS...

After finishing enabling are ghost to turn blue, then return back to normal, after six second,
we will go back into our MsPacman.cs and start there, by adding a reference to our Ghost script,
so we can use it there ...

After saving, and returning from getting out RedGhost script from within MsPacman,
we will set up our misnamed "Pills" which we will call "Dots"


********************************** Setup Dots ******************************

First, In the Dots empty, select all four Dot objects, and add circleColliders 2D to them.
Check, isTrigger for all Dots.

Next, we will continue in our MsPacman script, setting up our dots, in the OnTriggerEnter2D function,
continue there...
