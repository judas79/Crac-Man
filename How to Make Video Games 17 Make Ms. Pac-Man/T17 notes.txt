https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PPE0eZEbJ8&list=PLGLfVvz_LVvSYnwKyw9xP5tEn7GSUWwZJ&index=18

You asked for it, and now here it is a Ms. Pac-man Clone! In this specific video I’ll cover how to draw all the sprite assets in Gimp
including the Ghosts, Ms. Pac-Man, GameBoard, Dots, etc. Then we’ll cover how to create a pixel precise grid layout, setup our project, 
create sprite sheets, create animations, sorting layers, and so much more! Understanding how grid based games work will dramatically 
increase the number of games you can make.

You can get all the images here.

After downloading the images, linked above, and changing them in gimp, we start by making all the folders,
for Assets, in the Unity app.
Change sample scene name to SampleScene
Then we drag all our assets, into thier coorisponding folders, in the Assets folder.
Change sample camera name to MainCamera, and settings to:
Position x: 13
Position y:14.5
Position z:-1
Scale x y : 1
Background : blue
size: 16

Put GridGB, in ou hierarchy, and setting:
position x : 13
position y : 14.5
scale : 1

SpriteSheet setting:
SpriteMode : Multiple
Pixels per unit : 16
Filter Mode : Point

Then press sprite editor:
type : grid by cell size
16x 16
slice
apply.

SpriteSheet 16 -19 drag into Scene window, rename MsPacman.
Make an animation named MsPacman, save in Animations folder.
MsPacman settings:
Position x : 14.5
Position y : 6.5
scale 1.2

add  sorting layer, name it MsPacman, thhen:
sorting layer : MsPacman
In anaimations click MsPacman, then in animator editor, click orange blob and set speed to .3.

Drag both Dot sprites, that are dots, into hierarchy and save in animation folder as Dots
Create prefab out of Dot.
Create Empty in hierarchy rename to Dots, put Dot in Dots
In animations click Dots hightlight orange blob and set speed to .3.

Drag you horizontal pill into hierarchy, then make it into a prefab.
Delete the sprite of pill in hierarchy and drag the prefab pill, into hierarchy.
rename it to HorzPill

Create Empty, then rename it to, PillsHoriz, then drag HorzPill into it.

Set PillsHoriz: (the folder)
position x = -.5
position y = -.5

Do the same for VertPill, using the vertical pill sprite.
Create empty name PillsVert and drag VertPill into it.

Set VwerPills:  (the folder)
position x = -.5
position y = -.5

Start plotting the first HorzPill in settings:
Position x = 1
Position y = 1
Then make duplicates to fill the horizontal pathways within GridGB, to the end of the first row,
then copy and paste the copy within the PillsHoriz, to fill all the rows, and delete the ones, that lie within walls.

Start plotting the first VertPill in settings:
Position x = 1
Position y = 2
Then work your way up vetically to fill all the vertical paths within GridGB as you did with the HorzPill, duplicate copies.

Next make thre duplicates of the Dot, Settings for them:
color = yellow...

Dot:
Position x = 1
Position y = 7

Dot(1):
Position x = 26
Position y = 7

Dot(20:
Position x = 1
Position y = 27

Dot(3):
Position x = 26
Position y = 27

Delete the pills at these coordinates, where the dots go.
